## Description

The BOB3 repository is a template for programming bob3 with Microchip Atmel Studio. Either in standard mode or with the batch file to load the bob3 config automatically. The bob3 comes with an Microchip (Atmel) ATmega88 which can be programmed through bobdude.


1. Supported Controller
   * Microchip (Atmel) ATmega88
1. Development Hardware
   * Bob3 ([nicai-systems](https://www.bob3.org/de/))
1. Additional Hardware
   * Some kind of pushbuttons.
1. Development Software
   * Microchip Atmel Studio (uC C/C++)

## Why Atmel Studio

Because sometimes you would preform your own functions or special functions. If you program with the bob3 online platform you can not use timer0 and other things, because they are defined in the bob3.h! Also it is possible that the level of the programmer has increased and the bob3 online plattform is simply to small.

## Getting Started

First you should install BobDude which is needed to program bob3. Tool can be found under following link:

* [BobDude](https://www.bob3.org/de/code)

After that clone or download the repository and copy the batch file ("bob3hex.bat") and the config files ("bob3.top.config", "bob3.bot.config") to the BobDude directory ("C:\Program Files\BobDude\bin\bobdude", or your installation directory). Then open the Microchip Atmel Studio solution in the cloned/downloaded directory.
